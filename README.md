In the Calculate class, there are multiple static methods of basic arithmetic funcions such as square rooting a number or converting radians into degrees.
The Access DoMath class tests out every method in Calculate and outputs the result from each calculation.
This shows my understanding of arithmetic calculations and basic Java without OOP.
