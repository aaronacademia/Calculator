# Calculator
In the Calculate class, there are multiple static methods of basic arithmetic funcions such as square rooting a number or converting radians into degrees.
The Access DoMath class tests out every method in Calculate and outputs the result from each calculation.
This shows my understanding of arithmetic calculations and basic Java without OOP.
This was written for the first coding project of AP Computer Science A.
Quadratic Describer is a branch off the Calculator project, utilizing some of the same static methods from Calculate.
It asks the user for 3 values of the quadratic formula and describes the features of the parabola produced from the formula.
This was my 2nd coding project for AP Computer Science A, and it shows my understanding of interacting with a user and evaluating input through Scanners.
